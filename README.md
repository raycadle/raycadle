# 👋 Yo! I'm Ray!
I'm a perpetual student who's always willing to learn something new and experience new adventures. You can usually find me infront of a computer or behind a steering wheel — sometimes both when I'm sim-racing. With a sharp mind and ferocious determination for success, there are no problems in life — only solutions.
